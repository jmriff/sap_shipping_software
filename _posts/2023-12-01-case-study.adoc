For customers who are seeking ways to drive more efficiency from their shipping processes and derive more value from their software investments, the Express Shipping Solution provides a set of tools that can connect your SAP-based shipping functions directly to those offered by parcel carriers such as UPS, FedEx, USPS and DHL via the shippers' own web services. This case study focuses on a recent implementation of the Express Shipping Solution at a large pharmaceutical company. This implementation was a successful example of how the Express Shipping Solution combines the native tools available in SAP, including the Express Ship Interface, and the cloud-based shipping services offered by parcel carriers, to improve the efficiency of a large shipping operation.
