The outbound delivery process in SAP starts with the creation of an outbound delivery. This can be done with reference to a sales order. Once the outbound delivery is created, the picking process can begin. This involves selecting items from a warehouse. Once the items have been picked, they can be packed. This involves placing items in packaging materials. Finally, the items can be shipped to the customer.
