A guide to developing an integrated SAP shipping strategy, assessing needs, and
understanding the basic functionality offered by various internet-enabled supply
chain shipping solutions.

== A Competitive Necessity

For companies with a shipping function, the Internet has become a critical tool
for business integration. It fosters greater cooperation between trading
partners and allows companies to work with their supply chain partners to better
serve customers, increase profits and drive down costs. However, with this
capability comes some challenges. For many companies, selecting the right tools
to drive cooperation and integration with partners can be a difficult choice.
The selection must be made carefully with the ultimate goal in mind: to improve
customer experience while also driving increased profitability and reduced
costs, with minimal organizational risk. The goal of this white paper is to help
companies understand the need for an integrated shipping strategy, determine how
to assess their needs, and to understand and compare the basic functionality
that is offered by various internet-enabled supply chain shipping solutions. As
part of this, we will discuss how internet-based API shipping can help
organizations better serve their customers, while also increasing profits and
