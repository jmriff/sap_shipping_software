case study]

=== ABSTRACT

For customers who are seeking ways to drive more efficiency from their
shipping processes and derive more value from their software
investments, the Express Shipping Solution provides a set of tools that
can connect your SAP-based shipping functions directly to those offered
by parcel carriers such as UPS, FedEx, USPS and DHL via the shippers’
own web services. This case study focuses on a recent implementation of
the Express Shipping Solution at a large pharmaceutical company. This
implementation was a successful example of how the Express Shipping
Solution combines the native tools available in SAP, including the
Express Ship Interface, and the cloud-based shipping services offered by
parcel carriers, to improve the efficiency of a large shipping
operation.

== Carrier Shipping Integration Guide

Selecting the Best Solution to Integrate Shipping Functions in SAP with
Parcel Carriers

image:../shipping-interface/assets/portfolio/slide-02.jpg[Shipping for SAP]

A guide to developing an integrated SAP shipping strategy, assessing
needs, and understanding the basic functionality offered by various
internet-enabled supply chain shipping solutions.

=== A Competitive Necessity

For companies with a shipping function, the Internet has become a
critical tool for business integration. It fosters greater cooperation
between trading partners and allows companies to work with their supply
chain partners to better serve customers, increase profits and drive
down costs. However, with this capability comes some challenges. For
many companies, selecting the right tools to drive cooperation and
integration with partners can be a difficult choice. The selection must
be made carefully with the ultimate goal in mind: to improve customer
experience while also driving increased profitability and reduced costs,
with minimal organizational risk. The goal of this white paper is to
help companies understand the need for an integrated shipping strategy,
determine how to assess their needs, and to understand and compare the
basic functionality that is offered by various internet-enabled supply
chain shipping solutions. As part of this, we will discuss how
internet-based API shipping can help organizations better serve their
customers, while also increasing profits and driving down costs.
